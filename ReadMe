we took healthy scans, mask them with rate (0<rate<1) and then tried to reconstruct them

for rate = 0.2 the reconstruction is almost perfect
when the trained model were given with healthy scans without mask, he again reconstructed them almost perfectly (left the scan as it is, see in 'test' folder)

further thoughts

there are few approaches we can take now

1) we can give the model scans with distal clot and hope that he will see the clot as mask, therefore he will reconstruct the scan without the clot
then we can take the difference between the original and the created and find the clot.

2) we can give the model the scans with distal clot, only this time we will mask it,
hopefully the model won't reconstruct the clot (its an anomaly that he not suppose to be aware of).
here we can play with the rate variable, the bigger it is the more blank pixels will appear in the scan,
and so the model will have more pixels to reconstruct which might harden the task to reconstruct the clot ( we dont want the model to succeed reconstruct the clot)

3) we can try to apply some simpler anomaly detection algorithm on the latent variable (the result of the encoder ) that we got
hoping that the model encoded enough information on the scan in that variable to differentiate normal scans from anomaly scans (distal clot)
again here we can play with the mask rate, the bigger it is the model will have to understand the architecture of the scan better,
and hopefully create better representation for the scans.


### we can use other scans (or maybe combining ) for that task ( like parenchyma ) so the clot will be bold, and it will be hard for the model to reconstruct the right color
### for now we are working with downscaled version of the scans, because its time consuming working with the 1024X1024 version.
